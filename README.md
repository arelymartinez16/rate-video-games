# Game Insider

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a comprehensive platform for video game enthusiasts to find in-depth reviews and ratings of the latest games. I built this project to provide a centralized hub where gamers can access detailed reviews, ratings, and insights about various video games. My goal was to create a community-driven platform where users can share their experiences, leave reviews, and engage with other gamers. By offering honest and thorough reviews, I aim to help gamers discover new games and avoid potential disappointments.
